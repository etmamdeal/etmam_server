# If 'app/uploads/' and 'app/logs/' are distinct from root 'uploads/' and 'logs/'
# and need to be ignored from within 'app/', they can be added as:
# app/uploads/
# app/logs/
# However, the generic 'uploads/' and 'logs/' at the root level might cover these
# if they are symlinked or if the intention is to ignore any such named folders.
# For now, I'll stick to the provided list which has specific app/ paths.
# The prompt listed:
# app/uploads/
# app/logs/
# So I will ensure these are present.
app/uploads/
